# The cond construct is broadly similar to the case statement, but without the pattern
# matching. If you would like, this allows you to write a catch-all clauseâ€”a guard matching
# true at the end. This often makes it easier to express logic based on broader comparisons
# than simple matching.

# Adding an if construct to convert numbers into atoms:
